# Invocation[^1]

I am surrounded by people. Let me feel the gravity of that.

Let me wield technology to make people feel loved, and let me always believe that to be its best use.

Let me build tools of empowerment, never of control or of exploitation.

Let me remember that code is art. But let my artistry be in worth to others, not in pure elegance and creativity.

I will make choicesâ€”of tools or technologies, of people or things. Let me be thoughtful, and not choose just what is exciting and new or what is familiar and known.

Let me be cognizant of what I do not know.

Let me always keep learning, and let me remember that those around me are learning, too.

Let me not sacrifice my work or the people I care about for my own growth or comfort. But if my context prevents me from growing, then let me have the strength to change it.

Let me find inspiration in the people around me. Let me show others that they are loved and appreciated, and let me always acknowledge the best I see in them.

Let me strive for excellence in everything I do, but let me be wise enough to back down when that hurts me or the people I love.

When I succeed, let me credit the people who helped me. And let me celebrate the successes of the people around me, whether I helped or not.

Let me be a conduit of inspiration, of gratitude, and of empowerment. Let me not spread panic or hate.

Let me remember that I am surrounded by people, and let me appreciate that everything I do has an effect on them. Let me make it one of love.
