          <h2>Cirqueti</h2>
          <p class="item_summary">A site for writers.</p>
          <div class="item_description">
            <p>
              Cirqueti is a website designed to make it easy for writers to
              get their work online, build portfolios, and get critique.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pieces of writing are added and revised through a simple,
              unobtrusive editing interface. Portfolios offer writers a
              simple &ldquo;about the author&rdquo; blurb, some contact
              information, and the ability to &ldquo;showcase&rdquo; their
              favorite authored items. The most important part of the system
              is an innovative javascript critiquing interface that makes it
              nearly effortless for anyone to pick a bit of text and comment
              on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cirqueti's implementation is currently being finished. It will
              soon enter a small, private alpha testing phase before being
              opened up in a public beta.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is a collaboration with Rory Marinich, who
              planned and designed the interface; my task is developing the
              backend. Cirqueti is implemented in 
              <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> using
              the <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django Web framework</a>.

          <h2>Light City</h2>
          <p class="item_summary">A Tumblr theme.</p>
          <div class="item_description">
            <p>
              Light City is a theme
              for <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, a popular
              mixed-media blogging platform. It was forked from &ldquo;I
              Like Lampposts&rdquo; to provide a much cleaner, simpler feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since its acceptance into
              the <a href="http://tumblr.com/themes/popular/">theme
                garden</a> (Tumblr's repository of user-designed themes), it
              has gained over 3,000 users.
            </p>
            <p>
              A sample tumblelog using this theme is
              available <a href="http://lightcitytheme.tumblr.com/">here</a>.
            </p>

          <h2>I Like Lampposts</h2>
          <p class="item_summary">A Tumblr theme.</p>
          <div class="item_description">
            <p>
              I Like Lampposts is another 
              <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> theme that I
              created, based
              on, well, lampposts. Using nearly the same clean
              <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code as
              Light City, it provides an entirely different visual layout
              and feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              This theme is unfinished and has therefore not been submitted
              to Tumblr's <a href="http://tumblr.com/themes/popular/">theme
              garden</a>. It can be seen in use
              on <a href="http://ilikelampposts.tumblr.com">a sample
              tumblelog</a> in its partially completed state, however.

          <h2>Not a Douche</h2>
          <p class="item_summary">A viral website.</p>
          <div class="item_description">
            <p>
              Not a Douche describes itself as a sort of
              &ldquo;antiFacebook&rdquo;. Its stated idea is to
              &ldquo;discourage interaction with other people&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <p>
              The interface is simple: just enter your name, then answer a
              series of questions you would probably never be asked by a
              real social networking site. When you've finished, you're
              taken to your &ldquo;profile&rdquo;, populated with your
              responses, and given a
              <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
              to hand out to those whom you think might be interested.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was a quick, simple experiment to get my hands dirty in
              building Web apps, written in
              <abbr title="the Hypertext PreProcessor">PHP</abbr>.
              Within a few hours of its launch,
              however, the website had amassed several thousands of
              users&mdash;by no means other than word of mouth. It was also
              featured on several radio stations.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was a collaboration with Rory Marinich, who
              handled the site's design. You can find Not a Douche
              at <a href="http://notadouche.com/">notadouche.com</a>. <em>(Note:
                it is unmaintained, and changes in the database setup have
                rendered it mostly dysfunctional for the moment.)</em>

          <div class="item_description">
            <p>
              Hash was the first theme I created for
              <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              It was thrown together quickly because I wanted a simple
              personal theme. The design is somewhat reminiscent of a Perl
              or shell script.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hash is available in Tumblr's
              <a href="http://tumblr.com/themes/popular/">theme
              garden</a> and currently has
              nearly 300 users. A sample tumblelog made for it can be found

          <h2>LectureNotes</h2>
          <p class="item_summary">An application for students.</p>
          <div class="item_description">
            <p>
              LectureNotes is a system designed to make electronic in-class
              note-taking both feasible for students and more effective than
              traditional paper-based methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              The system consists of an efficient, rich editor and an
              <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> vocabulary
              to describe notes. The interface aims to be extremely
              user-customizable and provide an effectively
              &ldquo;lossless&rdquo; storage format that maintains
              contextual information in addition to a simple notes tree.
            </p>
