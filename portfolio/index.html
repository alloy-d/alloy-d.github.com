    <h2>Cirqueti</h2>
    <p class="item_summary">A site for writers.</p>
    <div class="item_description">
      <p>
        Cirqueti is a website designed to make it easy for writers to
        get their work online, build portfolios, and get critique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pieces of writing are added and revised through a simple,
        unobtrusive editing interface. Portfolios offer writers a
        simple &ldquo;about the author&rdquo; blurb, some contact
        information, and the ability to &ldquo;showcase&rdquo; their
        favorite authored items. The most important part of the system
        is an innovative javascript critiquing interface that makes it
        nearly effortless for anyone to pick a bit of text and comment
        on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cirqueti's implementation is currently being finished. It will
        soon enter a small, private alpha testing phase before being
        opened up in a public beta.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is a collaboration with Rory Marinich, who
        planned and designed the interface; my task is developing the
        backend. Cirqueti is implemented in Python using
        the <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django Web framework</a>.

    <h2>Light City</h2>
    <p class="item_summary">A Tumblr theme.</p>
    <div class="item_description">
      <p>
        Light City is a theme
        for <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, a popular
        mixed-media blogging platform. It was forked from &ldquo;I
        Like Lampposts&rdquo; to provide a much cleaner, simpler feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its acceptance into
        the <a href="http://tumblr.com/themes/popular/">theme
        garden</a> (Tumblr's repository of user-designed themes), it
        has gained over 1,800 users.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sample tumblelog using this theme is
        available <a href="http://lightcitytheme.tumblr.com/">here</a>.

    <h2>I Like Lampposts</h2>
    <p class="item_summary">A Tumblr theme.</p>
    <div class="item_description">
      <p>
        I Like Lampposts is another Tumblr theme that I created, based
        on, well, lampposts. Using nearly the same clean HTML code as
        Light City, it provides an entirely different visual layout
        and feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This theme is unfinished and has therefore not been submitted
        to Tumblr's theme garden. It can be seen in use
        on <a href="http://ilikelampposts.tumblr.com">a sample
        tumblelog</a> in its partially completed state, however.
