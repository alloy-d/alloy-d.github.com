      <p>
        Cirqueti is a website designed to make it easy for writers to
        get their work online, build portfolios, and get critique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pieces of writing are added and revised through a simple,
        unobtrusive editing interface. Portfolios offer writers a
        simple &ldquo;about the author&rdquo; blurb, some contact
        information, and the ability to &ldquo;showcase&rdquo; their
        favorite authored items. The most important part of the system
        is an innovative javascript critiquing interface that makes it
        nearly effortless for anyone to pick a bit of text and comment
        on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cirqueti's implementation is currently being finished. It will
        soon enter a small, private alpha testing phase before being
        opened up in a public beta.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is a collaboration with Rory Marinich, who
        planned and designed the interface. I am developing the
        backend.
